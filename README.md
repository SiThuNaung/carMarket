Hi My name is Si Thu Naung(id-6530287) and I am the only group member.
This project is about Car Market and in the first page(dashboard) you can see the all the car models and brands available in the website by looking at the stack bar chart.
At the buttom u can see more specific detail of available car together with pie char distributed with car brands.
Another page(highlighted car) is where you can high light the car to be able to see at the top.
Cars highlighted will not be lost even if the page is refreshed.
